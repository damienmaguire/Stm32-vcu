/* This is an interface for a BMS to provide minimal data required
 * for safe battery charging.  The BMS must be able to provide the
 * following data:
 *   1. Maximum and minimum cell voltages
 *   2. Maximum and minimum cell or module temperatures
 * Each BMS module must log the above data as well as provide a
 * function to return whether charging is permitted and the maximum
 * charge current.
 * The function Task100Ms() will be called every 100ms and should
 * be used to implement a timeout for receiving fata from the BMS.
